# Python Django Web Framework - Full Course for Beginners

This repository contains source code from [Python Django Web Framework - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5mRW0jo-U4) video.


Let me share my thoughts about this course.

Yes, author of this video really did very hard work. I respect his work. But at the same time its true that it was mostly a waste of time. I even didn't completed the full course. I left last 40 mins.

So, I will highly discourage anyone who thought to take this video course.
